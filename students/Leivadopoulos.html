        <p>
            My name is Ioannis Leivadopoulos, I live in Thessaloniki since
            21/2/2005. Last year I graduated from the high school and now I
            study at CityCollege.

            When I was younger I used to play chess and football. Growing up I
            realised that I really enjoy videogames and technology.

        <p>
            That's why I am here today... to follow my dream in Computer
            Science!

        <h3 style="background-color: gold">What did I do for the Website:</h3>
        <p>
            I was responsible for the "clubs" of our website. The first thing I
            had to do was to decide which clubs to review. To tell the truth it
            was easy for me to decide because I live in Thessaloniki and have
            gone to them many times.After that I had to write a small
            description about them. The next step was to find some pictures.
            After a lot of research and many bad quality pictures I ended up on
            Facebook. There were the official pages for every club. So Facebook
            was my main source. Since I had choosen which pictures I want for my
            webside I put them to a carousel. About css every member of our team
            did his own personal styling. We showed each other our job, we discussed
            about it, made some changes and ended up here.
