        <h3 style="background-color: gold">What did I do for the Website:</h3>
        I was responsible for the "bars" of our website.I wrote a
        description for each one of them and added some photos from Facebook and
        Instagram. Last but not least i created a css file so i can style the
        site and showed it to my collegues, we discussed about it and combined
        everyones jobs in one.
